### 1. Non-Piracy and Anti-DRM Clause
The Software is strictly intended for legal and legitimate purposes related to modding and enhancing games.

### 2. Generated Content and Distribution
The Software allows for the creation of custom content (e.g., mod metadata files). You are free to share and distribute user-created files. However, any files or content that are property of the original game, such as decrypted game files or deobfuscated code, should never be shared or distributed under any circumstances. You are solely responsible for ensuring that all content generated using the Software does not violate copyright laws or the rights of the original game creators and publishers (Kit9).

You may not modify, distribute, or sublicense the Software except as expressly permitted in this Agreement and the Software's license terms.

### 4. No Warranty
The Software is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. The Licensor does not guarantee that the Software will be free from errors or interruptions.

### 5. Termination
If you violate any of the terms of this Agreement, your license to use the Software will automatically terminate. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the Software and destroy all copies in your possession.

### 6. Limitation of Liability
In no event shall the Licensor be liable for any damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, or use, arising out of or in connection with the use of the Software, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

### 7. Governing Law
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your Jurisdiction], without regard to its conflict of law principles.

By using the Software, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA.


**Please just use the Software for good and not evil.** My goal is to uplift the community and respect the creator of what has allowed Burial to even exist - not to make their life harder. Thank you! üçÖ
