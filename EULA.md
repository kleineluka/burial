**End User License Agreement (EULA)**

This End User License Agreement (the "Agreement") is a legal agreement between you (the "User") and Zoey (the "Licensor") for the use of the game modding tool (the "Software"). By installing, copying, or using the Software, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.

### 1. Non-Piracy and Anti-DRM Clause
The Software is strictly intended for legal and legitimate purposes related to modding and enhancing games. Under no circumstances may the Software be used to engage in piracy, unauthorized copying, or circumventing digital rights management (DRM) protections. You agree that you will not use the Software to:
- Bypass DRM systems in any form.
- Engage in the illegal distribution of copyrighted game files or assets.
- Violate the terms of service or copyright of the original game creators and publishers (Kit9).

### 2. Generated Content and Distribution
The Software allows for the creation of custom content (e.g., mod metadata files). You are free to share and distribute user-created files. However, any files or content that are property of the original game, such as decrypted game files or deobfuscated code, should never be shared or distributed under any circumstances. You are solely responsible for ensuring that all content generated using the Software does not violate copyright laws or the rights of the original game creators and publishers (Kit9).

### 3. Third-Party Asset Downloading and Data Collection
The Software may, from time to time, fetch and download assets (such as mod files, latest application version, or repository JSON files) from third-party servers or services. These assets are necessary for the proper functioning (ex. downloading a mod) of the Software. Burial itself does not collect or transmit personally identifiable information from users beyond a random hash and app version, but your operating system's [WebView](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebView) may collect or transmit data as per its own privacy policy. 

### 4. Third-Party Asset Usage and Installation
Burial can download files from provided URLs. You are responsible for ensuring that the files you download and install are safe and do not contain malware or other harmful code. The Licensor is not responsible for any damages or loss resulting from the use of third-party assets or the Software. Burial itself does not host, distribute, or provide any third-party assets - Burial only fetches assets from the provided URLs (repositories or user-input) and installs them on your device.

### 5. License Grant
The Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Software for personal and lawful purposes in accordance with this Agreement. You may not modify, distribute, or sublicense the Software except as expressly permitted in this Agreement and the Software's license terms. You can see more about the license terms in the [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/kleineluka/burial/blob/main/LICENSE) file.

### 6. No Warranty
The Software is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. The Licensor does not guarantee that the Software will be free from errors or interruptions.

### 7. Termination
If you violate any of the terms of this Agreement, your license to use the Software will automatically terminate. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the Software and destroy all copies in your possession.

### 8. Limitation of Liability
In no event shall the Licensor be liable for any damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, or use, arising out of or in connection with the use of the Software, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

### 9. Governing Law
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Australia, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

### 10. Acceptance
By using the Software, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA.


**Please just use the Software for good and not evil.** My goal is to uplift the community and respect the creator of what has allowed Burial to even exist - not to make their life harder. Thank you! üçÖ
