**Notice:** For now, this is less of a changelog and more of a commit summary. A proper changelog will be created once the project is actually more stable and released. So, enjoy the spam for now 🥰

## Version 0.0.1 🍅
- UI refactor, highly WIP.
- Started a basic settings page and system.
- New `sub` folder in `src/sub` for more advanced features that will require their own web template, rather than following the simple style of the main page (ex. pop out for image preview, mod creator).
- Start update notification system.

## Version 0.0.0 🍅
- Initial release! 
- Working decryption of .k9a files.
- Generating some sprite templates works. This required a lot of front-end and back-end work, as well as byte-patching and json parsing, so I will probably need to streamline this.
- Basic UI created. It is okay..ish.
- This is a rough draft and there is a lot left to be done, but never say never! :)
