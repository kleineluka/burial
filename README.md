<!-- Warning -->
<div align="center">
<h2>Warning: Big Burial Update In Progress.</h2>
<p><b>Burial is currently porting features to work with TCOAAL V3 (Decay Part 1). Asset encryption and decryption has been updated (in under 1 hour it was cracked!) but other features such as compiling mods will take more time to update. Similarly, I will add support for old encryption/decryption again soon, for archival purposes. This is all because Nemlei changed the encryption again. If she spent this much time on making the game as she does on anti-piracy, the game may be done by now. But don't worry, we're working on it :)</b></p>

<!-- Install (Mods) -->
# Installing Mods üî™

Burial has dedicated sections for installing mods and Tomb (modloader), or you can do everything in one-click in the modpacks section. Mod metadata is fetched from [Llamawa.re](https://llamawa.re/mods/), [Burial's curated list](https://github.com/kleineluka/burial/blob/main/api/foreign.json), and [Peachy's Visions](https://peachy.codeberg.page/visions). Burial also supports downloading mods from URLs, including GameBanana, Github, and direct links. 

**Burial is not associated with any mods and is simply a mod manager. Please only download mods that you trust. Burial does not host or distribute any mods and will only add mods when they can be downloaded from their official source.**

Further reading: [Submit my mod to Burial](https://github.com/kleineluka/burial/wiki/Adding-Mods-&-Packs#i-want-to-submit-a-mod-i-made), [submit somebody else's mod to Burial](https://github.com/kleineluka/burial/wiki/Adding-Mods-&-Packs#i-want-to-submit-somebody-elses-mod), and [submitting a modpack to Burial](https://github.com/kleineluka/burial/wiki/Adding-Mods-&-Packs#i-want-to-submit-a-modpack). If you are having trouble with a third-party mod, please see [why doesn't Burial support this or that mod?](https://github.com/kleineluka/burial/wiki/Problems-and-Questions#question-why-does-burial-not-support-this-or-that-mod)
