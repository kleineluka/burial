# Features 🐰
- **Decryption** ✂️: Decrypt/encrypt files from/to .k9a, sift through and export categories of resources, and generate templates of assets to make your own.

- **Pretty GUI** 🌸: Based on Ashley's colours, responsive, scales with your screen size, easy to navigate, all that stuff.. ~~and a lot of emojis~~

# Contribute 🩷
**For development**, Burial uses a `Rust backend` and a `Web frontend` with Tauri bridging the two. Additionally, some `Python scripts` are used to assist in development. Burial also utilises data storage techniques such as `JSON` and `Byte Patching`. The game uses `Javascript` to run, so modifications are made in that. If any of this interests you~ please feel free to start opening pull requests!

**For bugs and requests**, these are highly welcomed too! Please note that this was developed and tested on Windows, so Mac and Linux users pplease let me know of any bugs. Some files are specific to Windows as well (such as Game.exe).. so it will be interesting to deal with, eventually.

I also maintain a **Trello**, so if you are interested in being a frequent contributor, please let me know and I can add you to the board!

Detailed programming information and other contributing information will come soon - **TBA!**
