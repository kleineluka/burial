<!-- Features -->
# Features 🐰
Burial is a program for **mod players**, **mod creators**, **content creators** and **data miners**! Burial has something for everyone~ 🍅

- **Mod Manager** 🍱: One-click install of modpacks, manage Tomb modloader, browse and download mods, manage installed mods, and (beta) manage multiple instances of the game.
- **Resources** ✂️: Decrypt/encrypt files from/to .k9a, export categories of resources, generate asset templates, parse/import dialogue, and decrypt/modify/manage save files.
- **Reversing** 🧬: Targeted code injection, export/deobfuscate/comment the game's run-time code, manage NW.js SDK's, enable developer tools, view game information, and create backups of your game files.
- **Mod Tools** 🖍️:  Create an RPG Maker project, export an RPG Maker project to a Tomb mod, convert a non-Tomb mod to Tomb, edit mod json files, edit repo json files, and generate mod differences.
- **Knowledge** 📔: Easily access modding resources in one convenient place.
- **Easy and Safe** 🍵: Burial only takes a few clicks to get you playing mods, has lots of tooltips, and implements safety guardrails to protect your saves.
- **Quality of Life** 🌸: Pretty GUI with character-based themes, persistent settings, built-in tutorials, update checking, lots of emojis..

# Documentation 🥩

The tech stack 🍡 is a Rust back-end (Tauri framework), a Javascript front-end (vanilla), Python scripts to aid in development, TypeScript (Deno) for deobfuscation, and Javascript for game modification. Whew, that was a lot! If this sounds like something you may wanna help out with, check out the [Contributing page](https://github.com/kleineluka/burial/wiki/Contributing) on the Wiki.
