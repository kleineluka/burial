- **Resources** ✂️: Decrypt/encrypt files from/to .k9a, export categories of resources, generate asset templates, parse/import dialogue, and decrypt/modify/manage save files.
- **Reversing** 🧬: Targeted code injection, export/deobfuscate/comment the game's run-time code, manage NW.js SDK's, enable developer tools, view game information, and create backups of your game files.

- **Knowledge** 📔: Easily access modding resources in one convienent place.
- **Easy and Safe** 🍵: Burial only takes a few clicks to get you playing mods and has safety guardrails in place.
- **Quality of Life** 🌸: Pretty GUI with character-based themes, persistant settings, built-in tutorials, update checking, lots of emojis..
