# Features 🐰
- **Decryption** ✂️: Decrypt files to .k9a, encrypt files to .k9a, sift through and export categories of resources, and generate templates of assets to make your own.
- **Reversing** 🧬: Inject code into the game, export and deobfuscate the game's run-time code, manage NW.js SDK's, enable developer tools, and create/manage backups of your game files.
- **Modding** 🖍️: WIP.
- **Knowledge** 📔: WIP.
- **Settings** 🍪: Save default configurations to reduce repetitive tasks.
- **Optimised and Cross-Platform** 🦄: Executables are provided for Windows, Linux, and MacOS - plus, it's a super duper tiny program that can run on any potato!
- **Pretty GUI** 🌸: Based on Ashley's colours, responsive, scales with your screen size, easy to navigate, all that stuff..
- **By Fans, Not Thieves** 🥰: A legal copy of the game is required to use Burial. Burial will **never** implement any anti-DRM tools.

**For development**, Burial uses a Rust backend and a Web frontend with Tauri bridging the two. Additionally, some python scripts are used to assist in development. **For bugs and requests**, these are highly welcomed too! Please note that this was developed and tested on Windows, so Mac and Linux users please let me know of any bugs.

Detailed programming information and other contributing information will come soon - TBA!
