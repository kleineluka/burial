<!-- Install -->
# Install ☕
**Executables will not be provided until a stable version is completed.**
1. **Download** the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/kleineluka/burial/releases).
2. **Run** the installer, silly!
    <br>
    Question 1. [Why is it flagged as unknown/malicious?]()
    <br>
    Question 2. [Why can't the program be portable? (Hint: It kind of is?)]()
3. **Open** the program and **enjoy**! If you have any issues, please refer to the [Documentation](#documentation-).

<!-- Documentation -->
# Documentation 📻
Please view the [Wiki](https://github.com/kleineluka/burial/wiki)! If you want to skip right to help with installation, please head over to the [Installation and Help](https://github.com/kleineluka/burial/wiki/Installation-and-Help) page. If you are having trouble with the program beyond installation, check out the [Problems and Questions](https://github.com/kleineluka/burial/wiki/Problems-and-Questions) page. I hope these help! 😇

The tech stack 🍡 is a Rust back-end (Tauri framework), a Javascript front-end (vanilla), Python scripts to aid in development, TypeScript (Deno) for deobfuscation, and Javascript for game modification. Whew, that was a lot! 😅
