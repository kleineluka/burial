<!-- Warning -->
<div align="center">
<h2>Warning: Big Burial Update In Progress.</h2>
<p><b>Burial is currently porting features to work with TCOAAL V3 (Decay Part 1). Asset encryption and decryption has been updated (in under 1 hour it was cracked!) but other features such as compiling mods will take more time to update. Similarly, I will add support for old encryption/decryption again soon, for archival purposes. This is all because Nemlei changed the encryption again. If she spent this much time on making the game as she does on anti-piracy, the game may be done by now. But don't worry, we're working on it :)</b></p>

# Features 🐰
Burial is a program for TCOAAL mod players, mod creators, or just about anybody who likes the game~ 🍅

- **Mod Manager** 🍱: One-click install of modpacks, modloader manager, browse/download mods (from various sources), manage installed mods, install mods from external URLs, one-click mod installation from websites (burial:// protocol), switch mods easily with a profile system, and preview upcoming mods.
- **Resources** ✂️: Decrypt/encrypt .k9a files, export categories of resources, generate asset templates, parse/import dialogue, and decrypt/modify save files.
- **Reversing** 🧬: Targeted code injection, export/deobfuscate/comment game run-time code, manage NW.js SDK's, manage developer tools, view game information, and create backups of your game files.
- **Mod Tools** 🖍️:  Turn the game to an RPG Maker project, export an RPG Maker project to a mod, convert a non-Tomb mod to a Tomb mod, decompile a mod, edit mod.json files, edit repo.json files, and generate mod version differences.
- **Knowledge** 📔: Easily access modding resources in one convenient place.
- **Easy and Safe** 🍵: Burial only takes a few clicks to get you playing mods, has lots of tooltips, and implements safety guardrails to protect your saves.
- **Quality of Life** 🌸: Pretty GUI with character-based themes, settings, built-in tutorials, update checking, lots of emojis..
- **Fast, Small, and Open** 🦄: Built with Rust, a native webview (<30mb, no Electron!), and a forever open-source mindset.

<!-- Install (Mods) -->
# Installing Mods 🔪

Burial has dedicated sections for installing mods and Tomb (modloader), or you can do everything in one-click in the modpacks section. Mod metadata is fetched from [Llamawa.re](https://llamawa.re/mods/), [Burial's curated list](https://github.com/kleineluka/burial/blob/main/api/foreign.json), and [Peachy's Visions](https://peachy.codeberg.page/visions). Burial also supports downloading mods from URLs, including GameBanana, Github, and direct links. 

**Burial is not associated with any mods and is simply a mod manager. Please only download mods that you trust. Burial does not host or distribute any mods and will only add mods when they can be downloaded from their official source.**

Further reading: [Submit my mod to Burial](https://github.com/kleineluka/burial/wiki/Adding-Mods-&-Packs#i-want-to-submit-a-mod-i-made), [submit somebody else's mod to Burial](https://github.com/kleineluka/burial/wiki/Adding-Mods-&-Packs#i-want-to-submit-somebody-elses-mod), and [submitting a modpack to Burial](https://github.com/kleineluka/burial/wiki/Adding-Mods-&-Packs#i-want-to-submit-a-modpack).
