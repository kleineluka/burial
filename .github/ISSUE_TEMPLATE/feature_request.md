**Where would this feature go?**
What portion of Burial is this related to? For example: would it be part of the mod manager, or maybe part of the decryption tool? 

**Is this an improvement of something that exists, or a brand new idea?**
Can we do something better, or did you think of an original idea?

**What does this feature do?**
Generates 9000 kittens and gives them all to Ashley!

**Are you able to help?**
Can you open a pull request? Does the feature require other assets (ex. art) that you can provide?
