# Credits and Acknowledgements üéâ
- **[RPG Maker MV](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/eula)** was used to create the game and thus many features of the game are related to this engine. RPG Maker is not affiliated with Burial, and please support the engine by purchasing it if you are interested.
- **[Basil's Wiki](https://coffin-wiki.basil.cafe/)** has been a great resource for getting started with modifying the game. Furthermore, my implementation ([**Hausmaerchen**](https://github.com/kleineluka/burial/tree/main/src-backend/bundled/hausmaerchen)) of [**Webcrack**](https://github.com/j4k0xb/webcrack) to deobfuscate code was inspired by [**Basil's Grimoire**](https://codeberg.org/basil/grimoire).
- **[LlamaToolkit](https://github.com/Llamaware/LlamaToolkit/)** ([**GLWTPL**](https://github.com/me-shaon/GLWTPL)) was referenced for portions of Burial's original [cipher.rs](https://github.com/kleineluka/burial/blob/main/src-backend/src/utils/cipher.rs) implementation. Similarly, **[Llamaloader](https://github.com/Llamaware/LlamaLoader)** has a neat little trick to find the game installation.
- [**RPG Save Converter**](https://github.com/13xforever/rpgsave-converter) (MIT) was a great read for understanding the save format.
