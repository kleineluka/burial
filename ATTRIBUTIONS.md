# Credits and Acknowledgements üéâ
- **[RPG Maker MV](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/eula)** was used to create the game and thus many features of the game are related to this engine. RPG Maker is not affiliated with Burial, and please support the engine by purchasing it if you are interested.
- **[Basil's Wiki](https://coffin-wiki.basil.cafe/)** has been a great resource for getting started with modifying the game. Furthermore, my implementation ([**Hausmaerchen**](https://github.com/kleineluka/burial/tree/main/src-backend/bundled/hausmaerchen)) of [**Webcrack**](https://github.com/j4k0xb/webcrack) to deobfuscate code was inspired by [**Basil's Grimoire**](https://codeberg.org/basil/grimoire).
- **[OneLoaderImageDelta](https://github.com/rphsoftware/OneLoaderImageDelta)** (MIT) was referenced for my implementation of OLID, which also referenced Basil's TypeScript implementation [OLID.ts](https://codeberg.org/basil/OLID.ts).
- **[LlamaToolkit](https://github.com/Llamaware/LlamaToolkit/)** ([**GLWTPL**](https://github.com/me-shaon/GLWTPL)) was referenced for portions of Burial's original [cipher.rs](https://github.com/kleineluka/burial/blob/main/src-backend/src/utils/cipher.rs) implementation. Similarly, **[Llamaloader](https://github.com/Llamaware/LlamaLoader)** has a neat little trick to find the game installation.
- [**RPG Save Converter**](https://github.com/13xforever/rpgsave-converter) (MIT) was a great read for understanding the save format of RPG Maker MV games.
- [**Concursus**](https://github.com/MadMax1960/Concursus) was an awesome reference for GameBanana's endpoints implementation!

- Burial can install **third-party** resources to assist in mod loading and creation. [**Tomb**](https://codeberg.org/basil/tomb) by Basil can be installed as the mod loader, **[Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno)** is used to run deobfuscation and is only installed if you choose to use it, and **[NW.js](https://nwjs.io/)** can be installed to run the game in developer mode (but TCOAAL comes with NW.js already, just not the dev one).
- Mods are pulled from the [**Llamaware Page**](https://github.com/Llamaware/Llamaware.github.io/tree/main/src) and **[Burial's API](https://github.com/kleineluka/burial/blob/main/api/foreign.json)**. Naturally, any mods installed through Burial are the **property of their creator**. 
- **While Llamaware tries to ensure that mods are safe, we cannot guarantee that they are. Use mods at your own risk. This risk is greatly increased if you install mods from sources other than Llamaware (like Burial's API for third-party mods). Burial is not responsible for any damage caused by mods. Use your head!**
